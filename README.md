# fractal_regex

this is an attempt at a [r/dailyprogrammer challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2fkh8u/9052014_challenge_178_hard_regular_expression/)

it's really incomplete, but you can run

`pip install Pillow`

then

`python fregex.py`

and you'll get a little UI with a canvas and a textbox, put a regex in the box and hit enter

the regex should only care about the characters 1, 2, 3, and 4, such as `.*1`
